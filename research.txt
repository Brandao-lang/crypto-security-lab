The breach I am choosing to write is on the data breach Sony was victim to in 2014. In this event the hackers gained access to confidential information and personal user information for millions of people. They claimed - "Among the 'unprecedented' elements of the attack...was the fact that the malware used was not detectable by antivirus programs." (https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/12/11/massive-security-breach-at-sony-heres-what-you-need-to-know/?sh=293112fc44d8). Althought this forbes article writer believes that such an attack was not "unprecedented" and that this type of attack that targets data is nothing new and Sony is trying to save face about the massive blunder.  Sony had appearntly been warned about "deficiencies in its information security program, including the use of weak passwords" leading up to the attack (same source as earlier).
