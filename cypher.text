Cypher: There will be a key which is a string of letters, so for example a key can be 'lock', and each single letter of the key corresponds to its number in the alphabet. So for example the key 'lock' starts with the letter 'l'. 'l' is the 12th letter in the alphabet. So for the first letter of the encrypted phrase we will shift the enccrypted letter 12 spaces to the left to get the original letter from the plain text, looping back to 'A' if we hit 'Z'. In this process each letter of the key will match up with each letter of the encrypted message and we will repeate through the key when the message is longer than the key itself. So for 'I love cryptology' we will line up each letter with the key 'lock'. It will looks like this: 'I love cryptology' = 'locklocklockloc'. When this process is completed the encrypted message will be 'uargqrujalrwrvb'
